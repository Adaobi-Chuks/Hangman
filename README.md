# Hangman
Hangman is a word-guessing game. It keeps asking the user to guess characters until either they guess every character correctly and win or they miss a number of times and loose.

How the game works:

It chooses a random word from an array of words.

It displays a placeholder '_' in which reflect the number of characters in the word.

Then the gallow is shown, which reveals more as the player fails to guess a character correctly.

The game also keeps track of every incorrect guess the user makes. This helps the user not make the same mistake twice.

When the user guesses correctly, the word is replaced with the matching placeholder.

The user wins if all the words are guessed correctly.

The user fails if the number of misses exceed the number of letters in the random word.
